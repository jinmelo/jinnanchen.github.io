I'm currently a PhD candidate at NUS School of computing, under Prof [Gim hee Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leegh/), working on 3D computer vision, especially on 3D Human Digitization, including reconstruction and animation. I received my B.E. degree from Wuhan University in 2019. I received ME.ng degree from Nanyang Technology University in 2021 when I was working with Prof [Jiang Xudong](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/exdjiang/) and Dr [Qian Zheng](https://q-zh.github.io/). I was interned at Bytedance AI Lab in Singapore in 2021.
