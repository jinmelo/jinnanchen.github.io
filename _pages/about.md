I'm currently a PhD candidate at NUS School of computing, under Prof Gim hee Lee (https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leegh/), working on 3D computer vision. Before that, I received my B.E. degree from Wuhan University in 2019 and ME.ng degree from Nanyang Technology University in 2021 working with Prof Jiang Xudong (https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/exdjiang/) and Dr Qian Zheng (https://q-zh.github.io/).
