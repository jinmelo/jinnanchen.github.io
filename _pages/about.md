I'm currently a PhD candidate at NUS School of computing, under Prof [Gim hee Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leegh/). 
I received my B.E. degree from Wuhan University in 2019. I received ME.ng degree from Nanyang Technology University in 2021 with GPA of 5.0/5.0. During my master's study, I was supervised by Prof [Jiang Xudong](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/exdjiang/) and Dr [Qian Zheng](https://q-zh.github.io/). I was interned at Bytedance AI Lab, Singapore in 2021.

Currently, my research intersts are mainly on 3D computer vision, especially on 3D Human Digitization, including **Reconstruction** (implicit functions like Neural Radiance Fields), **animation** (Skining weights estimation and pose transferring) and **Genration** (Diffusion-based human generation). I am looking for academic discussions and collaborations.
