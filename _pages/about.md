I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at NUS School of Computing, under Prof [Gim hee Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leegh/). 
I received my B.E. degree from Wuhan University in 2019. I received an MEng degree from Nanyang Technology University in 2021 with a GPA of 5.0/5.0. During my master's study, I was supervised by Prof [Jiang Xudong](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/exdjiang/) and Dr [Qian Zheng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zq). I interned at Bytedance AI Lab, Singapore in 2021.

Currently, my research interests are mainly in 3D computer vision, especially in 3D Human Digitization, including **Reconstruction** (Implicit functions like Neural Radiance Fields), **Animation** (Skining weights estimation and pose transferring), and **Generation** (Diffusion-based human generation). I am looking for academic discussions and collaborations.
